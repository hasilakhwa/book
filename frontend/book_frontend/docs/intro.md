# ROS 2 Nervous System for Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the educational module on ROS 2 as the middleware nervous system in humanoid robotics. This comprehensive guide covers the fundamental concepts of ROS 2, its communication patterns, and how to describe humanoid robot bodies using URDF.

## Chapters

1. **[ROS 2 as a Robotic Nervous System](./ros2-nervous-system/ros2-as-nervous-system.md)** - Understanding the role of middleware in physical AI and biological nervous system analogies
2. **[Nodes, Topics, and Services](./ros2-nervous-system/nodes-topics-services.md)** - Communication patterns in ROS 2 with practical examples for humanoid robotics
3. **[URDF – Describing the Humanoid Body](./ros2-nervous-system/urdf-description.md)** - Understanding Unified Robot Description Format and its importance for control and perception

This module is designed for CS/AI students with Python knowledge entering humanoid robotics. Each chapter builds on the previous one to provide a comprehensive understanding of how ROS 2 serves as the nervous system for complex humanoid robots.
